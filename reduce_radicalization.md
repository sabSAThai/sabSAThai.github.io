It has brought to my notice by my very kind friends and my family that I have been increasingly inclining towards having radical thoughts and ideologies at my very core if not publicly. It is certain from the umpteen examples that radical views do no go good to an individual and to society. The seeds of excessive vanity, lopsided criticism and curbing rights get planted in oneâ€™s brain. A radical man sees what he wants to see and hears what he wants to hear.

I am giving a considerable thought towards curtailing these tendencies. I will enumerate the same below. 

- Accepting that you heading on a highway towards being radical is a key step.
- Do your own research. Real research is always a collective activity, and its results can make a large contribution to changing consciousness, increasing insight and understanding, and leading to constructive action. 
- Form groups and exchange views with people. Organize and debate.
- First interpret, then judge
