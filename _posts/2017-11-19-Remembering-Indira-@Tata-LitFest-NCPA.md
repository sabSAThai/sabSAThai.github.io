<p style="font-family:FontAwesome;">
On the eve of the 100th birth anniversary of [Mrs.Indira Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi), I attended a panel discussion "Remembering Indira" on the last day of [Tata Literature Live, The Mumbai Litfest 2017](http://www.tatalitlive.in/). On her centenary day, the panelists [P.Chidambaram(former Union Minister of Finance and writer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._Chidambaram), [Jairam Ramesh(Former Environment Minister)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jairam_Ramesh), [Mr. Peter Galbraith(former US Senator and diplomat)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Galbraith) and [Mr.Uday Mehta(American political scientist)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uday_Singh_Mehta) were talking about her legacy and her place in history. The discussion covered several topics ranging from Indira's personal life to how Indira's policies and actions affected Indian politics. Here's an excerpt of the talk. I might have missed many of the happenings of the show. All the comments/opinions are of the concerned people present in the discussion and not mine. Suggestions/amendments will be appreciated.

<p style="font-family:FontAwesome;">
Host: [Manu Pillai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manu_S._Pillai)
<br>
When: 10:30 to 11:30 am
<br>
Where: [Experimental Theatre Garden, NCPA](http://www.ncpamumbai.com/venue/experimental-theatre)
</p>

<p style="font-family:FontAwesome;">
The session started with the host pointing out an amusing irony "_Bunch of men on stage commemorating a Lady's Life Saga_". 




<strong>Host</strong>:  How was Indira as a Nehru’s Daughter? Was she Anti-Nehru in terms of her ideologies? How will you describe the relationship between her and Nehru?
<br> 
<strong>Uday Mehta</strong>: Both Indira and Nehru were part of the script “_colonization_”. Indira’s career was driven by a local context. She was highly contextual in her whole career. She responded to a context very rapidly. On the other hand, Nehru had a grand design. I would not consider Indira as a very intellectual “prime minister” unlike Nehru who was a great author too apart from being the prime minister. 

<br>

<strong>Host:</strong> (To Peter Galbraith) Your father was an ambassador and you were in close relations with Nehru and Indira. How will you describe her?
<br>
<strong>Peter Galbraith:</strong> When I met her at first, she was a 16. I wasn’t much focused on thinking over whether she will become next prime minister of the free India rather than the things you are interested in at that age. (_Audience laughs_). She was a shy person (_Quite surprising!_) I am sorry to say but at that time (1960), we didn’t think of a women becoming a leader at such great levels. Kennedy was interested in India but due to lack of miscommunication between Jacky(refers to Jack Kennedy) and Indira, there wasn’t much that could happen. Indira was elected as prime minister in the hope that she will be easy to control but obviously, the history speaks for itself and we know that she proved all of them wrong. 

<br>

<strong>Host:</strong> If there was no Indira, how Congress would be? 
<br>
<strong>Jairam Ramesh:</strong> I don’t answer such hypothetical questions. No point. He then continues. History writing in India is based on oral communication and not on structured research. Indira didn’t think of herself as a political person. She was a naturalist. She was happy dealing with nature. She even appealed all the CM’s to care for nature in their individual states. She was an unfathomable, complex personality. Responded to events and also created events. By 1971 she was creating events. She did have a great design for India. She integrated  Sikkim. It’s wrong to think that she only responded to events. Dismembered Pakistan in 1971. One of her famous reply to a Soviet official, “_We Indians know who we are_” on being questioned on the identity of Indians after being attacked by several rulers. (On being asked about the formation(establishment) he replies:) Dynasty is a loose word coined by some people to create a shallow negative effect on the masses(democratic masses). People are accountable as we have a voting system. 

<strong>Host:</strong> There was an increase in criminalization (in politics specifically). Does this criminalization open up spaces for others to exploit and thus increase it further?  As today it is a total mess. 
<br>
<strong>Chidambaram:</strong> Indira didn’t change the system. Also, one PM need not be a clone of other. Comparing her with Nehru doesn’t make sense. She was great at some policies, not very great at some. It’s painful to see India not celebrate Indira just like Russian revolution is not celebrated by the Russians. [Jairam Mukesh comments ‘Russian revolution is being celebrated at Agartala and Trivandrum’ (_audience laughs_)]. 

<strong>Host:</strong> Up to Nehru, there was a broad agenda for India w.r.t other countries. During  Indira, it became a bit vague. 
<br>
<strong>Peter Galbraith:</strong> Indira didn’t partition Pakistan. Pakistan partitioned itself. “_Audience applauds_”. At Indira’s time, India wasn’t influential at international platform nor it was during Nehru’s time. The reason being India didn’t have any followers. The 1971 war led to Pakistan turn to nuclear weapons. 

<strong>Host:</strong> Emergency was declared. The emergency was removed. Indira was removed from the party. But she was brought back very quickly. She was forgiven very quickly by Indian people. Did that had an influence on the future of Indian democracy. 
<br>
<strong>Jairam Ramesh:</strong> India ended the Korean War. Was a member of the neutral forces. Hence India did had an important influential role at the international platform. Indira had a worldview. It’s not that just in last recent 5 years, India became the darling of the world. 
[Peter Galbraith accepts misjudgments in the comments on 1950-1960 influence]  
Mr.Jairam Ramesh further emphasizes the influence of India. 

<br>
<strong>Chidambaram:</strong> Indira brought poor on agenda. Separated milk and water. Poor know what benefits them. Hence they brought her back. They had to bring her back.
Chidambaram makes a statement on Modi: _Modi has failed on his economic policies._ 
<br>

I had a personal interaction with the chair after the panel discussion, briefly with Mr.Peter Galbraith when he signed on my running notes. Attaching a pic of the same.
