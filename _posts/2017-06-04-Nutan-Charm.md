It’s quite easy to give in to the temptations, and assume that the camera worships your stature, and you cease to be the real you. And thus we have received so many of our larger-than-life characters. But watching _Nutan_ seems like an exercise in disbelief, an act of disregarding vanity. Her carefully etched out characters, infused with subtlety and grace, make a body of work populated by believable women, at a vast distance from our prima _divas_. From _Bimal Roy_ to _Vijay Anand_, every director she worked with became an ardent admirer of her meteoric talent. Nutan was not only blessed with a graceful personality and great acting skills, her voice was also quite serene. _Gautam Rajadhyaksha_ the famous photographer says about nutan, "Nutan was so beautiful she could be shot from any angle."

My personal favourites of Nutan are Sujata, Seema and Bandini of which Sujata and Bandini were directed by the legendary director, Bimal Roy. Director Bimal Roy was an introvertgenius who wasn’t outwardly expressive. If he liked any shot, he would just say‘OK’, and proceed to the next scene unlike directors who made it a point to letthe actors know that they have done well. One day while shooting an emotionalscene in Sujata, she witnessedsomething rare when the shot got over. Roy’s eyes were moist; a huge appreciationof her craft. In Bandini she plays a young prisoner and a jiltedlover. Her character could easily have become the victim of melodramatic histrionics.But she exercises a rare control and lets us see her face as the canvas for arainbow of emotions, from rage to compassion. The scene where she is driven byinsane fury and is about to commit murder is a masterclass of her craft. Aprisoner of fate, a captive of love, and a hostage of her own beauty, Kalyani is not only her career best work, but a performance that can rival any iconic workof Indian cinema.

In her last years she had become a satsangi. The word 'Om' meant a lot to her. She composed bhajans, sang them and despite the pain, she died with the conviction that her soul would merge with God after it fled the body.
