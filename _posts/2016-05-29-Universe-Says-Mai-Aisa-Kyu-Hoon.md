	You've just checked into your hotel room for a weekend. On entering the room you immediately walk onto the room's balcony to take in the eighth floor view. Unfortunately, the guardrail gives way the instant you lean on it and you fall. You scream, but for some reason you don't feel the pain you expected after falling on hard ground. Instead you find yourself immersed in an immense, soft bed. Of all the vehicles to fall into, you managed to hit an open trailer full of defective pillows from the local bedding factory.
	Why is it that conditions were just right for your survival? 
</p>

<p style="font-family:FontAwesome;">
	Anthropic principle is a philosophical idea which says that the observations of the universe must be compatible with living beings living in the space time of that universe. To phrase the principle in one line I would say “We see the universe the way it is because we exist in it.” 
</p>

<br />

<p style="font-family:FontAwesome;">
There are two versions of this principle
 <ul style="font-family:FontAwesome;">
  <li>Weak anthropic principle </li>
  <li>Strong anthropic principle </li>
</ul> 
</p>

<p style="font-family:FontAwesome;">
	<strong >Weak anthropic principle</strong> 	
</p>


<p style="font-family:FontAwesome;">
	It says that in a universe living beings can exist only if certain are met. In a way, it explains the existence of universal constants. It appears as if the values of the constants are carefully designed such that all the conditions are met. A debate point which can be used a theists.

	Now you may question that why are all these conditions met in the universe we see ? 
	The simple answer to this is that if these conditions weren’t satisfied then we wouldn’t be there here to observe it. You may also have observed that this principle supports the idea of bubble of multiuniverses and we live in the universe which supports life.

	<strong>Strong anthropic principle</strong> 
	I am not going to state what is the strong version is of anthropic principle since it is under debate and I would encourage to have a random shower thought session on the same.
