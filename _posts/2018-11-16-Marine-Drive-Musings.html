This was during Kalaghoda '18. It was a nice day. I was in total trans after watching the play "Spot On" by Makarand Deshpande. The acting was extremely captivating. I went to one of my favorite places in Mumbai, the Marine drive. I enjoy gazing at the sea, in the dark void or watch how the waves hit the concrete Y-shaped structures softly making a pleasant sound. I tried playing a few melodies on my newly bought harmonica. After multiple attempts, I was able to play the Sholay tune. I saw a smudge silhouette which suggested of a ship at the horizon. The horizon is more luminous as compared to the sky right above your head and I find that gradient very beautiful. The ship was quietly making its way through the cold water mass as if it were floating. I think thoughts do gather in the corner of your eyes, as the lump in your throat and the hollow part of the chest. A thought surfaced like a burp through the alimentary canal. I tried to weave the thought into poetry. I went something like this: 
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p align="center">
सामने दिख रहा समुद्र सोया हुआ है एक सुकुन की निंद,<br> लेहरो की आवाजे मन मे चिल्ला रही है,<br>
आखों से आसू मोती बनकर घुल गये काही समूनदर मे, <br>
एक इहसास हुआ की समूनदर मे नमक थोडा ज्यादा हो गया <br>

</p>

<br>
<br>
<p style="font-family:Roboto;">
After the poem struck through, illuminating the right half of my brain-garden, the saplings shot up and flowers blossomed. There goes a saying in neuroscience, "Neurons that fire together, wire together." Hence started a series of thoughts; thoughts which had beautifully carved edges; thoughts inscribed on yellow granite walls just like the gothic architecture of Mumbai. 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p style="font-family:Roboto;">
The sky above the sea far from the horizon was dark and hence revealed lots of stars. I was staring at a pair of stars which appeared fairly close to each other on the celestial spherical projection on my retina. They were twinkling. Vibrantly beautiful. I was trying to match their twinkling frequency with my eye blinking rate. After a while (probably after stroboscopically matching the two frequencies), the pair of stars started appearing like two bright eyes staring at me. Vibrantly beautiful still. I felt something called as opia which the dictionary of obscure sorrows defines as <i>"the ambiguous intensity of looking someone in the eye, which can feel simultaneously invasive and vulnerable"</i>. This partially personified version of the star-eyes started teasing me in a weirdly encouraging tone. I derived an eccentric implication from this exercise. 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p style="font-family:Roboto;">
I find consciousness a rather fascinating concept. And I certainly consider myself incredibly lucky to possess it. This consciousness also boasts of two eyes. These eyes are able to see stuff which our physical eyes are incapable of. The stuff that these consciousness-eyes see is I think projections of our thoughts onto the real world. I wondered if these personified-bright-blinking-eye-stars were a projection of these inner eye pair? 
<br>
When my consciousness teases me, I get the zen feels infused with inspiration.
