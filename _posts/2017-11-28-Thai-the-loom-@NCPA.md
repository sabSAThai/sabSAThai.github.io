On 28th November 2017 at Jamshed Bhabha theatre, NCPA, [Paramparik Karigar](http://www.paramparikkarigar.com/index.php) organized a Bharatnatyam dance event "Thari- The Loom" which I happened to attend. Paramparik Karigar an association of craftsmen was founded in 1996. The principle aim of Paramparik Karigar is to preserve and promote traditional art and craft of India. Critically acclaimed Bharatanatyam dancer Padma Shri, Malavika Surakkai and troupe put forth a performance which brought to audiences a lasting experience of the richness, versatility and profound beauty through the traditional practices of dance and weaving.

As it was given in the description of the event, 
Thari-The Loom’ is a confluence of traditional practice informed by contemporary sensibilities which extends the language of classical dance from India. The innovative dance choreography is inspired by the sari - the traditional hand woven 'unstitched garment' from India and it explores the fundamental concepts that are shared between the two seemingly different but essentially connected disciplines of dance and weaving: space, structure, motif, symmetry, proportion, relationship, alignment. Malavika Sarukkai endeavors to create through inventive group choreography a dynamic "dance cloth" that explores the artistic relationship of the constant warp and variable weft within the structure of the loom.


Malavika Surakkai on her journey of embodiment towards attempting to explore the underlying subtle connections of rhythms between dance and other naturally embedded activities around says _"for as long as I remember the sari has been the part of my life. As a young dancer, the sari was a proclamation. When I draped it around my twelve-year-old body, I felt a new sense of purpose. As I grew up it became other things as well; something that spoke intensely of who I was. It wasn't simply a piece of cloth and unstitched garment. It was an emotion, a state of mind, sometimes a statement. The looms spoken rhythms that have always been a part of my life in dance, As I observed more attentively, the loom revealed other secrets as well. I saw connections there that linked it to poetry, music, myth and dance design. I learned of the war distort long vertical threads that mark the length of the sari and defined the core of the loom. They spoke to me of the constant and I heard in them the notes of Krishna's divine flute, essential and beckoning. I learned of the weft threads that cross and embrace the warp horizontally to create design, motive, and color. In the beginning, I thought of these conversations have been private. It's been something that spoke specifically to me but in time they demanded to be more widely heard and ever so instantly they became a movement, became a dance, became 'Thari, the Loom'"._ 


Malavika Sarukkai visited Kanchipuram where they recorded some of the musical soundscapes – that of the moving loom – she came across a weaver who told her that the sari wasn’t merely a product. “For the weaver, there’s a deep investment. There’s an emotional connect. After all, they would have taken hours and hours to weave each sari. It’s the same for a dancer who has a personal connect to dance. And just like each sari that’s woven is different from the other, each dance performance is different. How I dance today will be different from how I dance tomorrow,” she says.  



Watching Malavika Sarukkai and troupe live was an experience in itself. Dance full of grace always touches the very core of my heart and grace was oozing out from the beautiful and enthralling dance movements of the dancers. I couldn't help but observe the various geometric shapes and figures the performers displayed by complex but graceful movements of the body with simultaneously maintaining their wrists and palm in the beautiful _mudra_ position which is a trademark of Bharatnatyam. Actress Vidya Balan who also has a classical dance background was invited to commemorate Malavika Surakkai and troupe. Vidya said that she ditched a family function to come and witness MS's magnificent dance.  

Along with the lovely Bharatnatyam performance, there was an exhibition of beautiful handwoven sarees from all over India along with their description. It was alluring to see so many varieties of sarees to which I was never exposed to before.
