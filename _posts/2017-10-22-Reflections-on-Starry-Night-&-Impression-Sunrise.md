One of the most epic paintings I have ever seen. Can never stop staring at it. 
The gallery label at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York says:

"This morning I saw the country from my window a long time before sunrise, with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big," **Van Gogh** wrote to his brother Theo, from France.
Rooted in imagination and memory, The Starry Night embodies an inner, subjective expression of van Gogh's response to nature. In thick, sweeping brushstrokes, a flamelike cypress unites the churning sky and the quiet village below. The village was partly invented, and the church spire evokes van Gogh's native land, the Netherlands.

Painted in the Spring of 1873. _Sunrise_ by **Claude Monet** is a portrait of the Le Havre port located on the northern coast of France. Monet displays a brilliant use of color in the water to help portray a reflection of the rising sun. 

Throughout the years, _Claude Monet’s Impression, Sunrise_ has been celebrated as the quintessential symbol of the Impressionist Movement.  This renowned work of art is considered to be one of Monet’s “most poetic expressions” of his _Impressionism movement_. Developing in Paris in the 1860s, the influence of Impressionist Movement spread throughout Europe and eventually the United States. Its originators were artists who rejected the official, government-sanctioned exhibitions, or salons, and were consequently shunned by powerful academic art institutions.
