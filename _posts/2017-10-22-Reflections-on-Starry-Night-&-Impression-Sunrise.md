One of the most epic paintings I have ever seen. Can never stop staring at it. Starry night is a paiting of contrast, connection and transition. The sky is full of roar expressed as long strokes and below there's a quite village in the sweet pre-dawn sleep. The night is slowly melting down into a beautiful dawn under the inspection of the morning star. Connecting earth and sky is the flamelike cypress, a tree traditionally associated with graveyards and mourning. 
"Looking at the stars always makes me dream," he (Van Gogh) said, "Why, I ask myself, shouldn't the shining dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France? Just as we take the train to get to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death to reach a star"    

The gallery label at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York says:

"This morning I saw the country from my window a long time before sunrise, with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big," <strong>Van Gogh</strong> wrote to his brother Theo, from France.
Rooted in imagination and memory, The Starry Night embodies an inner, subjective expression of van Gogh's response to nature. In thick, sweeping brushstrokes, a flamelike cypress unites the churning sky and the quiet village below. The village was partly invented, and the church spire evokes van Gogh's native land, the Netherlands.

"The Olive Trees" is another painting of Van Gogh where he studies starry night further.

Painted in the Spring of 1873. <i>Impression:Sunrise</i> by <strong>Claude Monet</strong> is a portrait of the Le Havre port located on the northern coast of France. This paiting was shown at the "Exhibition of the Impressionists" in April 1874. Monet displays a brilliant use of color in the water to help portray a reflection of the rising sun. The painting gives a suggestion of the early morning mist, at that time clogged with the industrial smoke of the city, and has a strong relationship to the earlier views of mist and fog done by the artist in London in 1870. The hazy characteristics, informal and spontaneous brushstrokes are some of the classic features of impressionist paintings.   

The brilliantly bright orange sun close to the horizon expressessing itself through the light it scintillates which dances on the wav sea and thus puts up a mesmerizing treat for eyes. 

Throughout the years, Claude Monet’s <i>Impression:Sunrise</i> has been celebrated as the quintessential symbol of the Impressionist Movement.  This renowned work of art is considered to be one of Monet’s “most poetic expressions” of his _Impressionism movement_. Developing in Paris in the 1860s, the influence of Impressionist Movement spread throughout Europe and eventually the United States. Its originators were artists who rejected the official, government-sanctioned exhibitions, or salons, and were consequently shunned by powerful academic art institutions. 

This painting is currently at Marmottan Monet museum, Paris.
