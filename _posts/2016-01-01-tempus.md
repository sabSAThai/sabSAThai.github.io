Calvin and Hobbes is my favorite comic strip and my source of happiness! Also, it's insanely funny!

### Self-Improvisation (Notes from Self-Introspection sessions)
1. Listen. Give equal time to hear and understand what a person is trying to express. You will have time to express your opinions.
2. After you are done with saying anything, avoid unnecessary trailing. Stop when you have presented your point.
3. Being jovial is fine. Being serious at times is important as well.
