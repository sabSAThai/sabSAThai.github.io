<p>I have been cultivating a garden since my sophomore year at IIT Bombay. It has grown from a simple hobby to one of the closest and most cherished moments of my stay. Sharing few photos of my beautiful green souls!</p>

<p>Three airlines (and now apparently railway officers) have banned Kunal Kamra from availing their service. 
More than imposing the policies and rules of the airlines, I see this as an attempt at boot-licking and suppressing voice that asks questions.
In December of 2019, Saadhvi Pragya delayed a SpiceJet flight by 45 minutes over an emergency seat issue. SpiceJet apologized to the passengers for the trouble and there wasnâ€™t any ban imposed on her.
Claiming a moral high when it doesnâ€™t exist in the first place is just a cover-up to hide the real reason.</p>
