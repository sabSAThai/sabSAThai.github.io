I"9<p>Three airlines (and now apparently railway officers) have banned Kunal Kamra from availing their service. 
More than imposing the policies and rules of the airlines, I see this as an attempt at boot-licking and suppressing voice that asks questions.
In December of 2019, Saadhvi Pragya delayed a SpiceJet flight by 45 minutes over an emergency seat issue. SpiceJet apologized to the passengers for the trouble and there wasn’t any ban imposed on her.
Claiming a moral high when it doesn’t exist in the first place is just a cover-up to hide the real reason.</p>
