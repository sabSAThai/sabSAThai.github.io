<!-- 			This poem is about how people aren't able to communicate their thoughts, their pain to the world, to the people around. While describing their struggle, there's an urge to come out the wells of silence. -->

					<h3>This one's for you</h3>
				</header>
<p_t>
		This one’s for you, the one who would trade anything for a chance to vanish into the forest, <br />
		How beautiful it is, that you get up even when all you want to do is just rest <br />
<br />
		How exclusively fantastic is to hope with tears in your eyes,<br />
		What an art it is to heal others when your own soul is bleeding under a disguise <br />
<br />
		How excellently you cover your wounds and muster strength,<br />
		Even when you yourself need it at length   <br />
<br />
		How quietly you sneeze your paroxysm of pains into an adorable excuse me,<br />
		How admirably you condense your sorrow into tears and hang them on a quiet tree <br />
<br />
		How comfortably you swallow the lump in your throat back inside you,<br />
		What a charm you wear while your emotions are stripped and thrashed black and blue <br />
<br />
		What an impeccable game you play with hiding your worries in wrinkles of your forehead,<br />
		How amazingly are you coping with the fact that somewhere something of you is dead<br />
<br />
		But I have seen a recurring dream,<br />
		With blossoms kissing you being the theme<br />
<br />
		I have seen you in a canvas of thousand paints, <br />
		And the calmness of as many saints 
<br />
		I will play the melodies of rustling leaves and that of a rushing river, <br />
		And bring the lining of the clouds covered in silver <br />
<br />
		I have heard the tiny jumping pulse under your skin,<br />
		And I will tune it with mine with a grin  <br />
<br />
		When you are close to doing something you might regret,  <br />
		Just promise me you won’t forget,<br />
		That I am here for you, <br />
		Waiting with your magic glass shoe.<br />

					<h3>The Jar of Fireflies</h3>
				</header>
<p_t>
Under the sky painted blue and gray, <br />
Out on a winter’s day, <br />
When the evening's empire returned to the bed, <br />
And the night’s spell was cast instead, <br />
The sky was no longer blue<br />
Colors were changing hue<br />
Long oblique shadows on the hills <br />
And the cool breeze swayed the daffodils, <br />
<br />

There comes a little girl with her glass jar <br />
To catch the fireflies and gaze at the stars,<br />
The fireflies came out with their light<br />
Creating a dazzling sight<br />
One by one she collects them in the jar, <br />
Just like treasured beads on a necklace are <br />
<br />

The moon overlooked with an admonishing smile <br />
Knowing this will last only for a while<br />
The little girl moves to the city<br />
Where the lights are very pretty <br />
<br />
But the city is sullen with greed, <br />
Making it difficult for the fireflies to breed <br />
In her mind does the city invade And all her dreams fade <br />
<br />
The girls looks up to the moon <br />
With a shuddering sigh and a teary gloom <br />
The city night climbs into her eyes becoming exasperating expression <br />
To fill the emptiness and the dying desperation<br />
<br />

The bigger picture that the city paints <br />
Is suffused with cold complaints <br />
Where nothing matters much and nothing much matters  <br />
Where the less it matters, the less it matters <br />
Is it correct to bring new lives one after another? <br />

					<h3>Dead Poets</h3>
				</header>
<p_t>
The dead poets want to talk. <br />
They are waiting, <br />
<br />
Like words in a pen,<br />
Like a trapped lion in a den, <br />
Like a butterfly in a cocoon, <br />
Like a thrilled kid in a classroom <br />
Like a bird in a cage <br />
Like a story in a page <br />
<br />
Talk to them, break the shackles of time, <br />
Kiss their gorgeous words with a smile <br />
Their happiness will radiate a light which is so bright, <br />
That the birds would sing and think it were not night <br />
