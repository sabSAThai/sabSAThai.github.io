<p>I have been cultivating a garden since my sophomore year at IIT Bombay. It has grown from a simple hobby to one of the closest and most cherished moments of my stay. Sharing few photos of my beautiful green souls!</p>

<p>Three airlines (and now apparently railway officers) have banned Kunal Kamra from availing their service. 
More than imposing the policies and rules of the airlines, I see this as an attempt at boot-licking and suppressing voice that asks questions.
In December of 2019, Saadhvi Pragya delayed a SpiceJet flight by 45 minutes over an emergency seat issue. SpiceJet apologized to the passengers for the trouble and there wasn’t any ban imposed on her.
Claiming a moral high when it doesn’t exist in the first place is just a cover-up to hide the real reason.</p>

Movies are great, but plays are just so real! The raw acting, the connection of the audience with the actors, it's all so powerful! In my third year, i.e year 2018, I made a new year resolution of watching atleast 10 plays in the whole year. And by the month of February, I was done with  &lt;/p&gt;
