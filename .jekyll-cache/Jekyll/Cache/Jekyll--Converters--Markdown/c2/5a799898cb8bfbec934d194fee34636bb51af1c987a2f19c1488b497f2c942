I"ø<p>What can you do?</p>

<p>Everyday we have to grapple with the fact â€“ like a morning ritual â€“ that we are in a deep fascist state and everyday it feels more eerie and real. And I think this is the morning of 2020. And this is how itâ€™s going to be for a while. We go to sleep in an authoritarian state, and we wake up in one.</p>

<p>But I know I have to resist this. I have to fight for a better future, a better world. And hereâ€™s something we all can do:</p>

<p>One of the things the people in power want is a passive and quiescent population. So one of the things you can do to make life uncomfortable for them is not to be passive and quiescent. Demonstrations, writing letters, and voting can all be meaningful â€“ it depends on the situation. But the main point is â€“ itâ€™s got to be sustained and organized.</p>

<p>If you go to one demonstration and then go home, thatâ€™s something, but people in power can live with that. What they canâ€™t live with is: <em>Sustained pressure that keeps building</em>. Talk to representatives of your ward. Organize and Engage in discussions and debates. Do your own research.</p>

<p>If elections are just something in which some portion of the population goes and pushes a button every couple of years, they donâ€™t matter. But if citizens organize to press a position and pressure their representatives about it, elections can matter.</p>

<p>Representatives of your ward can be influenced much more easily than ministers, and ministers can somewhat more easily by the prime minister who is usually immune. You can organize on a scale that will influence representatives. You can get them to your homes to be yelled at by a group of neighbors, or you can sit in at their offices. Whatever works in the circumstances.</p>

<p>If you are a working person, you donâ€™t have time â€“ alone â€“ to take on the power company. Thatâ€™s exactly what an organization is about. Thatâ€™s exactly what unions are for. Form groups. Speak up. Listen to otherâ€™s views. Discuss.</p>

<p>You can also do your own research. Itâ€™s no big mystery, and itâ€™s not intellectually difficult. It involves some work, but anybody can do it as a spare-time job. And the results of that research can change peopleâ€™s minds. Real research is always a collective activity, and its results can make a large contribution to changing consciousness, increasing insight and understanding, and leading to constructive action.</p>

<p>Remember that education is successful when it teaches us to raise their voice against power structures, standing up for their beliefs, and fighting for a more equal and just society. The purpose of education never was limited to widening your economic prospects rather it presents you with the opportunity to critically question and the responsibility to engage with vital challenges both personal and societal/political. Now is the time, and the time is passing. If you donâ€™t ask questions today, you wonâ€™t get the answers tomorrow.</p>
